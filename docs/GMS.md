## How to buy membership if you have two or more children playing

Follow steps 1-4 above.

THEN, click on your oldest child and buy “`Family - two or more Mini/Youth players (1st player)`” at £140.

You can then purchase memberships for any other playing children in your family by clicking their name and buying “`additional player on family/senior membership`” at £0.

This means that if you have 2 or more playing children the maximum you will pay is £140.
