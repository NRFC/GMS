# HOW DO I CREATE AN ACCOUNT

Start by visiting https://gms.rfu.com/GMS/Account/Login. \
Please check first that you do not have an existing GMS account already set up for you, before you create a duplicate account by clicking on the ‘Forgot Password’ link on the Sign in page for GMS and follow the instructions. Enter your email addresses (or if you have more than one email account) and/or username. If you do not know this please contact your club/school/university where they can look up your profile and send you your credentials and the link for you to reset your password.

### If you don’t have a GMS account already:
From the landing page for you to be linked to a club click on Find a Club to search and locate the club by name, postcode or town you want to be linked with, click the tick as circled in blue and then click on Create Account.
